## About
This is the summer research project done during my time at Denison University. The research was funded by the Lisska Center Summer Scholars program and was advised by Assistant Prof. Belinda Azenui at the time. I had also created a poster for the project, and it was later shown in the Fall semester during a conference at Denison University. 

## Data & Replication Files
The data and R files are included in a zip file. I have more datasets than I actually used in the writing of the paper, and that is because I wanted to do EDA with the other datasets. Apologies in advance if it is confusing, but following the .Rproj file should be sufficient.
